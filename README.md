# Android App Documentation

## Overview

This documentation outlines the process of creating an Android app using React Native. The app's main functionality involves recording sound at regular intervals, generating Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) from the recorded samples, displaying the MFCCs in the app, and sending the data to a backend server in JSON format with OAuth2 authentication.

## Requirements

- Node.js
- React Native CLI
- Android Studio (for Android development)
- Xcode (for iOS development)

## Installation

1. Install Node.js: [Node.js Installation Guide](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Install React Native CLI globally:

   ```bash
   npm install -g react-native-cli
   ```

3. Set up Android Studio or Xcode based on your platform:
   - [Android Studio Installation Guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/install)
   - [Xcode Installation Guide](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)

## Development

1. Create a new React Native project:

   ```bash
   npx react-native init SoundRecorderApp
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd SoundRecorderApp
   ```

3. Install necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Recording Sound

1. Integrate a sound recording library such as `react-native-audio-recorder-player` into the project.
2. Implement functionality to start and stop sound recording at regular intervals.

## MFCC Generation

1. Use a library such as `react-native-mfcc` to generate MFCCs from the recorded sound samples.
2. Ensure the MFCCs are computed accurately and efficiently from the recorded audio data.

## Displaying MFCCs

1. Design a user interface to display the generated MFCCs in the app.
2. Use appropriate React Native components to visualize the MFCC data in a user-friendly manner.

## Sending Data to Backend Server with OAuth2 Authentication

1. Implement OAuth2 authentication in the app using a library such as `react-native-app-auth`.
2. Obtain access tokens from the authentication server for sending requests to the backend server.
3. Format the MFCC data into JSON format.
4. Set up communication with the backend server using REST APIs and include the OAuth2 access token in the request headers.
5. Send the formatted MFCC data to the backend server endpoint with OAuth2 authentication.

## Testing

1. Test the app thoroughly on various Android and iOS devices and emulators.
2. Ensure sound recording, MFCC generation, data display, data transmission, and OAuth2 authentication functionalities work as expected.
3. Handle errors and edge cases gracefully to enhance app robustness.

## Deployment

1. Build the app for Android and iOS platforms:

   ```bash
   npx react-native run-android
   npx react-native run-ios
   ```

2. Publish the app to Google Play Store (for Android) or Apple App Store (for iOS) following the respective guidelines and procedures.

## Conclusion

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide for developing an Android app in React Native that records sound, generates MFCCs from the recorded samples, displays the MFCCs in the app, and sends the data to a backend server in JSON format with OAuth2 authentication. Follow the outlined steps to create a functional and secure app with the desired features.
